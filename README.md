# Angular Large Form with Sub-Forms in Sub-Routes

This is a demo Angular application showcasing how to create a large form that contains sub-forms existing in sub-routes. The main form is initialized with pre-patched data, and sub-forms are managed as nested form groups to ensure state persistence across navigations.

## Features

- Main form with pre-patched data.
- Sub-forms managed as nested form groups.
- Routing between sub-forms without losing form state.
- Dynamic form control management.
